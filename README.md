# Email-Slack-Alerts

This past summer, I worked at a company that manages a large database of applicants and jobs with details about each. This project checks if there is any sort of anomaly in this database on a daily basis and automates an email and slack message to the company in the case of an anomaly. I worked very closely with the CTO of the company to implement this code and learned a lot along the way. Some skills I gained were debugging, learning SQL, and using technologies such as AWS, Postman, and Docker.
